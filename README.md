My Tic Tac Toe game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure, laying out the 3x3 grid using a table or divs. Each cell in the grid represents a potential move and can be interacted with. CSS styles the game board, including the grid lines, the appearance of the X's and O's, and any hover or active states. JavaScript handles the game logic. It tracks player turns, checks for winning combinations by examining the state of the grid, and prevents illegal moves (like clicking an already occupied cell). The JavaScript also manages the game state, determining when a player has won or when the game results in a draw. It updates the display to reflect the game's progress and can trigger alerts or messages to announce the winner or a tie. This combination of technologies creates a playable Tic Tac Toe game directly in the browser.
